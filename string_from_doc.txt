10 Abstract
11 This primer was funded by the Noble Order of Historians and has been certified to be free of
12 bias. The primer replaces a previous version. Destroy all previous versions.
13 Sigtora is a multifaceted city with many institutions that can be daunting for newcomers. Here
14 we offer an attempt to condense the ancient history down into a few short paragraphs for ease of
15 digestion. We start with the foundation of this plane and follow notable events up until Bodleian
16 Standard Year 19219.

23 as it is the firm belief of the authors as well as the official position of the Noble Order of Historians
that students may not be permitted access to Certified Unbiased h¯
24 for academic purposes.
25 This document is an updated version of an earlier 19231 article which has since been found to
26 incorporate several sources that were found to have been tampered with. In the years since the
27 corruption of source material has been discovered we have undertaken a large effort to prevent
28 the further leakage of misinformation into works that were previously certified as unbiased docu29 ments.
30 2 Discovery and Mechanics: Bodel Mobius 0-17138
A long time ago a [group of individuals / race / entity] h¯ i
31 known as Bodels either created or found
the nugget of truth that the whole of Sigtora today is based upon. 1
32 Vestiges of this discovery are
33 no longer visible in modern Sigtora having been destroyed sometime in the mid Xanathos period,
likely in conjunction with the creation of the satellite now known as High Sigtora.2
34 Records for this
35 longest period of history are exceptionally sparse and many of those that do exist are unfit for
36 publication in a primer which must meet standards of impartiality and bias free sources.
37 We are able to note the date which the period of the Bodel Mobius ended from primary sources
38 from the mid Xanathos period. The Bodelian Standard Calendar was established very close to the
39 year zero of that calendar however the exact delay between the founding of the Mobius has yet to
be determined. Current estimates are between ten and one hundred years post establishment.2
40
The length of the calendar year may not have been consistent across each recorded year.3
41
42 2.1 Planar Mechanics
43 The Bodel Mobius represents the structure of foundation of this plane. Unlike most extradimensonal
44 spaces or planes that may be formed by beings like demi and quasi planes, the Bodel Mobius exists
45 outside of the standard cosmological model. Whether this is due to far more advanced creators,
46 exists as a quirk or hole in the cosmological model, or is because there is special significance to
i
Theories differ as to the nature of Bodels, whether they are divine entities, a mortal race, or a yet undiscovered
grouping of the various races more in tune with the arcane
2
47 its creation has been debated for centuries. Over time, the debate has shifted closer to confirming
that the this special situation is the result of an incomplete standard cosmological model.4
48
49 While the Bodel Mobius appears to sit outside of the current understanding of the cosmos, certain
rules5 must be rigorously adhered to in order to prevent collapse of the Mobius. 50 6 While a full
51 discussion of those rules is far beyond the scope of this paper, suffice it to say that magic is
exceptionally intertwined with the nature of Sigtora.h¯
52 Several events have occurred in the past which
have caused structural changesh¯
53 to Sigtora.
54 The borders of Sigtora are shrouded in a substance often called mist. Many investigations into
its properties have been made with little firm conclusions. 55 7 While individuals and groups have
56 occasionally entered into the mist, attempts to collect reports from those who emerge by a reputable
source have failed.8
57
58 2.2 Remnants
59 The only confirmed and certified remnant from this longest period of history can be found in the
Bodelian Order.3
60 The Bodelian Order predates the other noble orders found today significantly.
Certain voicesh¯
61 claim that the Bodelian Order is still populated by Bodels however, as to date no
62 paper has confirmed that fact. The Bodelian Order provides a standard calendar for use by resi63 dents. The calendar has twelve months: Logic, Music, Rhetoric, Geometry, Axiology, Numismatics,
64 Theology, Arithmetic, Astronomy, Aesthetic, Peasantry and, Xenology. Each month is divided into
65 four weeks of eight days: Illday, Neday, Sumday, Knowday, Friday, Inda, Sheday, Changeday. It
66 should be noted that the names of the months and days are not original to the Bodelian Order
67 but rather transaltions of Bodelian into Common done by scholars at the Juster College of Letter
Studies centuries ago.9
68
69 3 Growth: Xanathos 17138-18448
70 A series of events that is unfit to print in any publication that has been Certified Unbiased took
place around 17135 and 17139 h¯
71 resulting in the Xanathos period of history. Further reading on this
72 period is recommended for a Sigtoran scholar but is exceptionally murky and not required for the
3
73 intended audience of this primer.
74 3.1 First Trade Routes
75 By 17200 trade routes began with which led to the influx of the current population of Sigtora today.
76 The first trade routes were likely between the elemental planes and neutrally aligned planes such as
77 Hamistagan. It is well accepted that these trade routes began shortly after the Blood War but then
quickly expanded out throughout the planescape.3
78 By 17400 races native to the Astral Plane such
79 as the Githyanki found their way to Xanathos and began to dominate the culture and trade of the
region. 10 Githyanki are responsible for many of the public works currently found in Sigtora. 11 80
81 Initial trade routes began to create the melting pot of culture which currently exists. By 17630
82 there was a strong need for public services and rules governing the usage of the unique location
that the Mobius offered. 10 83 In 17635, the loose collection of minor cooperatives which saw to the
84 safe keeping of the city began to form themselves into guilds. While a great many guilds claim that
85 their current form can be traced back to these original Xanathos guilds the records at the time show
86 only five to have been instrumental in the creation of the current form of government. This topic has
been the primary research goal of the Noble Order of Historians for a long period of time.8
87
88 To the highest degree of certainty the Noble Order of Historians has determined that the five foun89 dational guilds were: Worshipful Company of Scriveners, Worshipful Company of Paviors, Worshipful
Company of Mercers, The Guild of Adventurers, and The Guild of Beadles.8,h,¯ 12, 13, 10 90
91 3.2 Foundation of High Sigtora
92 Xanathos saw the creation of High Sigtora towards in 18403 as there became a need for those
93 involved with ensuring the merchant state’s operation to be removed from the dangerous politics
94 that were on the city’s streets below. High Sigtora marked a shift away from decentralized politics to
a more centralized system dominated by livery companies (also colloquially called major guilds) 14 95
96 which would now oversee the city in an official matter.
97 The administrative complex that had begun to spring up was levitated by a collection of mages and
98 placed into an orbit around Xanathos. Travel to and from High Sigtora was originally facilitated by a
4
99 series of gondolas that physically connected High Sigtora to the Low Square in Xanathos. However,
100 after a series of attacks in 17804 on High Sigtora which culminated in a siege of the complex by
101 Slaadi invaders the physical structure was severed in favor of a magical tether woven into the truth
of the Mobius.ii 102
103 3.3 Emissaries of Faerie
104 Shortly after the creation of High Sigtora and members of the Fey realms began to trickle in and
105 maintained a token presence in Xanathos. However, from the outset they created their own object
106 which they called Lune and placed it in orbit like High Sigtora. Lune was never approved in its
107 construction and caused a power struggle between Lune and the oligarchs of High Sigtora. A
108 combination of the Fey’s independent spirit and the newly separated government’s need to establish
109 themselves as the superior authority in Xanathos.
110 3.4 Revolution of 18442
111 In 18442 Sigtora became open to the Prime Material planes. What followed was such a rapid
influx of population and building that a higher number of Mobius Rupture Eventsiii 112 has yet to be
recorded.8
113 However, with this influx also came a great emigration of planar entities to the Prime
114 Materials. Following these events a shadow war played out from 18442 to 18446 until the city
115 sieges itself between 18446 and 18452.
116 4 Stabilization: Palli 18448 - 19120
117 In 18448 in response to the ongoing hostility Palli was declared first as an enclave within Xanathos
118 but eventually spread to cover the rest of Xanathos by 18452. Negotiations with High Sigtora and
119 Lune would last until 18455 with the signing of L’Accord du Palli which established Noble Orders
iiWhile not coherently confirmed, several certified sources agree that the Bodelian Order was involved in some manner,
however no records have yet to be found describing the nature of their involvement. Given the millennia that have
past since this incident, the Noble Order of Historians has offically considered these records as Lost | Untraceable
| Unconformable | Tampered (LUUT). As such a substainal reward is available for these records but contingent on
certification of the truthfullness of these records.
iiiMobius Rupture Events occur whenever a planar disturbance begins to rip the fabric of truth that Sigtora is built
upon. The purpose of the Office of the Chief Architect is to prevent such ruptures from permanent installations but a
great many events can cause such ruptures.
5
120 separated from the Guild system. L’Accord also shut off all contact with the Prime Material plane
121 until further notice, and set High Sigtora as the ultimate seat of power ending the power struggle
122 between Lune and High Sigtora.
123 4.1 Foundation of Noble Orders
124 The Noble Order of Historians, The Noble Order of Scryers, The Noble Order of Bankers, and the
125 Noble Bodelian Order (the latter of which was added in a special exception as they had never com126 municated with the world outside of their tower except for publishing a calendar every year).
127 4.2 Reopening
128 Late in this period, Palli opened itself back up to the Prime Material Plane as a result of fractures
129 introduced by members of the Unseelie Court staying at Lune. These fractures widened over time
130 unbeknownst to the Noble Orders and administrations in High Sigtora. The resulting cracks in
131 the system led many individuals to accidently end up on the Mobius which resulted in chaotic
132 administration and threatened to start a second civil war until intervention reopened limited travel.
There is strong evidenceh¯
133 to suggest that members of The Honorable Company of Sicas were paid
134 by a tax on all newcomers to remove evidence of means to arrive at Palli intentionally or otherwise
135 from the Prime Material Plane.
136 5 Modernity: Sigtora 19121 - Present Day
137 In an effort to democratize the running of the city state, the name of Palli was changed to Sigtora in
138 19121. While it has been a little more than a century since the change of name and change of heart of
139 the administration of the Mobius State, this period of time has not proven long enough for adequate
140 sources to be certified and many assertions are still in flux. However the authors recognize that
141 this section of the primer is often of greatest import to newcomers, especially mortal ones.
142 To that end we have established a frequently asked question section as well as some handy tables to
143 orient you. While all information contained within these questions and tables is certified unbiased,
144 we cannot make any guarantees as to its truthfulness. Any omission may be the result of time
6
145 passing between the writing of this article and your reading of it, or due to information that was not
146 available to the authors at the time of publication. We can certify that any omission was not the
147 result of bias or an attempt to mislead the reader.
148 All newcomers to Sigtora are invited to visit the Noble Order of Historians to review the current list of
149 LUUT material from recent times to be walked through the uncertified material with the assistance
150 of a trained historian. Those needing to earn money during their time here may find these lists
151 interesting purely for the reward values contained within.

<<Deep Birth Dreams>>
A summary as transcribed to iji during their conversation with a Dawn Titan
When I awoke from the beginning of time, I was already fully formed but yet, somehow I have
retained knowledge from before time. ΑΩ had dreamed me up and I felt a part of ΑΩ’s dream and
of ΑΩ. A deep space surrounded me in all directions, and I felt drowned in the magnitude of ΑΩ’s
imagination. I felt other presences here in the dream space, but could not reach out to them.
The world shifted and I felt the amniotic fluid of the world shift and form into solid objects, the
fortress walls within cell walls within walls of naught but rigid Τruth. Through another’s eyes I saw
the rising of two gods from a milk sea and immediately clash snuffing each other out. This act was
performed over and over again, and I ne’er saw them survive their encounters with the other.
At the same time, I felt a calling to emerge and to be born into this world by one more powerful
than I. I would be shown a time when I reigned as ambassador and sat by the side of Kossuth in the
Undying Pyre. Yet these words were unknown to me, this place was unknown to the world, and that
name had not yet been spoken into Τruth.
While still only a figment in the Overmind of the Overlord of the Overdiet I had a sudden pang and
felt true evil move through this mind and true anguish and true shame. An entire world born dead
into the astral milk sea, a scream.
Then I was named. I was named Arambar and I became.
Research Journal
A summary derived from Research Journal of Zibua Bod
This machine should not be possible and the further into it I look the more of myself I lose. I dare
not continue to experiment lest I be lost forever. This machine binds us all to the mobius we now
call home and I cannot determine the mechanism or the reason. This world was billed to me as a
heart of trade and commerce but why is it that when we leave we cannot truly be rid of ourselves
here. Who would have known that other primes existed?! How was I to know.
I started experimenting with nonliving matter and this damnable device. It appears that it can pass
through without harm but I do not trust my own results. If metal itself may have a god then surely
somewhere there metal has a soul as well. I must stop before I am gone but I cannot leave here,
what else am I to do?
The exploration of new planes should be left to those who have nothing to lose and no one to go
home to. I think this may be the curse of fey involvement but without their help I would never have
seen such sights and wonders. What is their role here? The Fey care not for information or trade.
After so many refused letters, I will finally ask the Mistress of Location in person, I seek an audience
tomorrow.



Temporics
A summary derived from Temporics: A Textbook of Time, a textbook at the
Unsightly University composed by a young Deneir, the Scribe of Oghma
Each plane contains a relation of time to another plane. While this author finds the bias towards the
mundane mortal beings of the material planes to be an afront to the nature of the work done at this
institution, for the weak-minded students who study here I will put it into simpler terms for them.
First, one must understand the distinction between the true time and the time subjective. There is no
Truth in time, only truth in experience. If it takes you ten seconds to tie your shoe, then it takes ten
seconds of true time to tie you shoe. If you can calculate the ratio of antimony required to neutralize
terra pinguis within a minute, then it takes one true minute for that calculation. The mettle of your
being however, may not agree with you for it follows the time subjective. This regulates the effects
of the plane itself upon your body. It is not possible to be cast out of a plane.
Upon the Prime Material, true time and time subjective are the same in all regards, and supposedly
this makes it a valid starting point for study. However, the same is true for the Outer Planes and this
is the real reason for this equality. In the Inner Planes each second of true time is two subjective
seconds. Those who study the healing arts should already be aware of the benefits of dispatching a
divine body who is poisoned or a particularly important mortal to the Astral plane. There subjective
time passes much much slower. For each subjective second that one spends in the Astral, twentyeight days and eight hours passes in true time, allowing treatment of their body to take place while
their own metabolic processes slow to a crawl.
